# Mimic

Worried about awkward, creepy, or downright dangerous interactions? This mobile app will help get you out of unwanted situations by mimicking alarms or phone calls.

# MVP

1. Alarm Mode / Call Mode where either the app sets off an alarm clock sound or starts a fake call
2. Mock call screen / customizable name for fake caller
3. Mock lock screen and hidden alarm / call buttons
4. Fake Screens to implement in order: Lock Screen, Coffee House App, Ecommerce, Chat
5. Option to have custom ringtones
6. Timed fake calls
7. Physical button triggers for calls (Pending research, possible stretch goal)

# Stretch Goals

1. SOS with app sending location to preselected contacts
2. App pings other users near the area for help
3. Root access / start Mimic from lock screen
