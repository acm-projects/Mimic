# Mimic

Worried about awkward, creepy, or downright dangerous interactions? This mobile app will help get you out of unwanted situations by mimicking alarms or phone calls.

# MVP

1. Alarm Mode / Call Mode where either the app sets off an alarm clock sound or starts a fake call
2. Mock call screen / customizable name for fake caller
3. Mock homescreen and hidden alarm / call buttons

# Stretch Goals

1. Support for different ringtones
2. A more subtle way to start the alarm or fake call: button click patterns or a touch combination in the app
3. More varied fake app screens. Ideas: Mimics a travel, restaurant, chat, or online shopping app.
